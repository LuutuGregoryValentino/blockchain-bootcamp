# My Solidity Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress in learning Solidity, smart contract development, and the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contracts

- `VisibilityExamples.sol`: A smart contract demonstrating function visibility (public, private, internal, external) and state mutability (view, pure, payable), as well as basic inheritance.

## How to Test This Contract in Remix IDE

You can easily test and interact with these smart contracts directly in your browser using the Remix Ethereum IDE.

1.  Go to [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2.  In the File Explorer, create a new file (e.g., `VisibilityExamples.sol`).
3.  Copy the content of the `VisibilityExamples.sol` file from this repository and paste it into the new file in Remix.
4.  Navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab (the icon with the Solidity logo) and compile the contract.
5.  Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (the icon with the Ethereum logo and arrow).
6.  Select `JavaScript VM` as the environment.
7.  Choose `AllSolidityFeatures` (the name of our main contract) from the contract dropdown and click "Deploy."
8.  Interact with the deployed contract using the buttons provided in Remix!

Happy coding!
